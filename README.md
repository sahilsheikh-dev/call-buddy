## 🚀 Project Overview

Call Buddy is built to solve a simple but painful problem:
**manual call tracking is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone.**

With Call Buddy, users can:

- Log in with predefined credentials
- View one unprocessed lead at a time
- Initiate calls directly from the browser (mobile-friendly)
- Record call outcomes, comments, and optional recordings
- Automatically move to the next lead after saving

The system enforces mandatory inputs to ensure **data discipline**, not wishful thinking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, fast front-end stack:

- **Vite** – lightning-fast dev server and build tool
- **React** – component-based UI
- **TypeScript** – type safety and long-term sanity
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** – accessible, composable UI components

No unnecessary abstractions. No bloated dependencies.
